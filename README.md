# heat
Heating flow control with heating curve and lowering at night.

I have been using it for several years. After some initial bugs, no more problems.

Required components:
 - 3 x DS18B20 (flow, return, inlet)
 - 1 x relay card with 2 relays (open/close valve)
 - 1 x RTC DS1307
 - 1 x SD card module (logging)
 - 2 x RS 485 modules (for communication with a master - optional)
 - 16x4 LCD
 - I2C LCD Adapter
